# shop

An in-progress digital store project.

Uses Node/Express.js along with MySQL.

Instructions:

1. For now, this project hosts the database locally, so this will only work if you have MySQL and Node.js installed. When you use your own password for the MySQL server, replace the example password in .env.example and then rename the file to just .env.

2. Create a schema called 'node-shop'.

3. Open the terminal and type in the following commands.
    - npm install
    - npm start
